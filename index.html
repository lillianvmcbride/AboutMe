    <h2>A Webpage About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Tacoma Washington and moved to Cedar Rapids when I was three years old. I attended Wshington High School and later Kirkwood Community College. I am currently taking courses in software development at DeltaV code school, a coding bootcamp sponsored by the non-profit NewBoCo. Through the years I've worked many different types of jobs: asian grocery store clerk, restaurant server, janitor, university fundraiser who calls alumnai, pizza delivery person, warehouse order picker, and assembly line worker to name a few. Eventually, I plan to teach elementary school art and move back out west.</p>
